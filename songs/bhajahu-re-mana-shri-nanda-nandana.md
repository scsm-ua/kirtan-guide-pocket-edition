# Bhajahu̐ Re Mana

### by Śrīla Govinda Dās Kavirāj

#### 1

    bhajahu̐ re mana    śrī-nanda-nandana
        abhaya-charaṇāravinda re
    durlabha mānava    janama sat-saṅge
        taraha e bhava-sindhu re

O mind, serve the son of Nanda’s lotus feet, which make one fearless. Having attained this rare human birth, cross over the ocean of material existence by associating with sādhus.

#### 2

    śīta ātapa    vāta variṣaṇa
        e dina yāminī jāgi re
    viphale sevinu    kṛpaṇa durajana
        chapala sukha-lava lāgi’ re

Day and night I remain awake, suffering from the heat and the cold, the wind and the rain. For a moment of flickering happiness I have uselessly served wicked and miserly men.

#### 3

    e dhana, yauvana,    putra, parijana
        ithe ki āchhe paratīti re
    kamala-dala-jala    jīvana ṭalamala
    (ei āchhe ei nāi    jīvana ṭalamala)
        bhajahu̐ hari-pada niti re

What is there in having wealth, youth, sons, and family? Life is tottering like water on a lotus petal (it is here, and then it is gone). O mind, serve the Lord’s feet.

#### 4

    śravaṇa, kīrtana,    smaraṇa, vandana
        pāda-sevana, dāsya re
    pūjana, sakhī-jana,    ātma-nivedana
        govinda-dāsa-abhilāṣa re

Govinda Dās desires to engage in the nine practices of devotion: hearing about, glorifying, remembering, praying to, attending to, serving, worshipping, befriending, and surrendering to the Lord.
