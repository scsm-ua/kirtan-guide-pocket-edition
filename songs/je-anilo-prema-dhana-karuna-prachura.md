# Viraha-gīti

### by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ye ānila prema-dhana karuṇā prachura
    hena prabhu kothā gelā āchārya ṭhākura

Where has Advaita Āchārya, the Lord who mercifully brought the wealth of divine love to this world, gone?

#### 2

    kā̐hā mora svarūpa rūpa kā̐hā sanātana
    kā̐hā dāsa raghunātha patita-pāvana

Where are my Svarūp, Rūpa, and Sanātan? Where is my Raghunāth Dās? Where are the saviours of the fallen souls?

#### 3

    kā̐hā mora bhaṭṭa-yuga kā̐hā kavirāja
    eka-kāle kothā gelā gorā naṭa-rāja

Where are my Raghunāth Bhaṭṭa and Gopāl Bhaṭṭa? Where is my Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj? Where has the great dancer Śrī Gaurāṅga suddenly gone?

#### 4

    pāṣāṇe kuṭiba māthā anale paśiba
    gaurāṅga guṇera nidhi kothā gele pāba

I will break my head on a rock, I will enter into fire—where shall I go to reach the reservoir of all qualities, Śrī Gaurāṅga?

#### 5

    se saba saṅgīra saṅge ye kaila vilāsa
    se saṅga nā pāñā kānde narottama dāsa

Not finding the association of Śrī Gaurāṅga, who performed His Pastimes with all these associates, Narottam Dās weeps.
