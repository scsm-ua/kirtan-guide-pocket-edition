# He deva bhavantaṁ vande

### By Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī Prabhu

#### 1

    he deva bhavantaṁ vande
    man-mānasa-madhukaram arpaya nija-pada- paṅkaja-makarande

O Lord, I offer my obeisance unto You. Please place the bee of my heart in the honey of Your lotus feet.

    yadapi samādhiṣu vidhir api paśyati na tava nakhā gramarīchim
    idam ichāmi niśamya tavāchyuta tad api kṛpādbhuta vīchim

O Achyuta! Although even Brahmā, in samādhi, cannot see the lustre of the tips of Your toenails, I have heard of the waves of Your wonderful mercy and I desire to see it.

    bhaktir udañchati yad api mādhava na tvayi mama tila-mātrī parameśvaratā tad api tavādhika- durghaṭa-ghaṭana-vidhātrī

O Mādhava! Although I don’t have even a sesame seed of devotion to You, Your supreme power is the creator of even more improbable miracles.

    ayam avilolatayādya sanātana kalitādbhuta-rasa-bhāram nivasatu nityam ihāmṛta-nindini vindan madhurima-sāram

O eternal Lord, may the bee of my heart steadily reside eternally at Your lotus feet, where there is an abundance of the most wonderful honey—which surpasses the nectar of immortality—and thus attain the ultimate sweetness.
