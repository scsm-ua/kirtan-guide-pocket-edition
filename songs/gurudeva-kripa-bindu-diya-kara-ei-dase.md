    gurudeva!
    kṛpā-bindu diyā    kara’ ei dāse
        tṛṇāpekṣā ati dīna
    sakala-sahane    bala diyā kara
        nija-māne spṛhā-hīna

O Gurudev! Give this servant a drop of your mercy, and make me more humble than a blade of grass. Give me the strength to tolerate everything, and make me free from any desire for personal honour.

    sakale sammāna    karite śakati
        deha nātha! yathā yatha
    tabe ta’ gāiba    hari-nāma sukhe
        aparādha habe hata

O master! Give me the ability to befittingly honour everyone. Then I will sing the Lord’s Name happily, and all my offences will be eradicated.

    kabe hena kṛpā    labhiyā e jana
        kṛtārtha ha-ibe, nātha!
    śakti-buddhi-hīna    āmi ati dīna
        kara more ātma-sātha

When will this soul attain such mercy and become fulfilled? O master! I am devoid of ability and intelligence, and greatly distressed. Please accept me.

    yogyatā-vichāre    kichhu nāhi pāi
        tomāra karuṇā-sāra
    karuṇā nā ha-ile    kā̐diyā kā̐diyā
        prāṇa nā rākhiba āra

When I examine myself for qualifications, I find none. Your mercy is everything. If you are not merciful to me, then, crying, I will no longer maintain my life.
