# Daśa-vidha Nāmāparādha

### By Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj

    hari-nāma mahāmantra sarva-mantra-sāra
    yā̐dera karuṇā-bale jagate prachāra
    sei nāma-parāyaṇa sādhu, mahājana
    tā̐hādera nindā nā kariha kadāchana

The Hari-nām mahāmantra is the best of all mantras and is distributed throughout the world by the mercy of the sādhus devoted to the Name. Never criticise such great souls.

    vrajendra-nandana kṛṣṇa sarveśvareśvara
    maheśvara ādi tā̐ra sevana-tatpara
    nāma chintāmaṇi kṛṣṇa-chaitanya-svarūpa
    bheda-jñāna nā karibe līlā-guṇa-rūpa

Vrajendra Nandan Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of all Lords. Śiva and all other gods are dedicated to His service. The Name is a wish-fulfilling jewel and a spiritual form of Kṛṣṇa Himself. Do not consider Kṛṣṇa’s Name to be distinct from His Form, Qualities, or Pastimes.

    “guru kṛṣṇa-rūpa hana śāstrera pramāṇe
    guru-rūpe kṛṣṇa kṛpā kare bhāgyavāne”
    se gurute martya-buddhi avajñādi tyaji
    iṣṭa-lābha kara, nirantara nāma bhaji

“The scriptures confirm that Guru is a form of Kṛṣṇa (SB: 11.17.27). In the form of Guru, Kṛṣṇa bestows His mercy upon the fortunate.” Give up the conception that Guru is a mortal, and all other types of disrespect, and attain your cherished goal: serving the Name eternally.

    śruti, śruti-mātā-saha sātvata purāṇa
    śrī-nāma-charaṇa-padma kare nīrājana
    sei śruti-śāstra yebā karaye nindana
    se aparadhīra saṅga karibe varjana

The Vedas, their mother, Gāyatrī, and *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam* worship the Holy Name’s lotus feet. Reject the association of any offender who criticises these scriptures.

#### 5

    nāmera mahimā sarva-śāstrete vākhāne
    atistuti, hena kabhu nā bhāviha mane
    agastya, ananta, brahmā, śivādi satata
    ye nāma-mahimā-gāthā saṅkīrtana-rata
    se nāma-mahimā-sindhu ke pāibe pāra?
    atistuti bale yei—sei durāchāra

The Name’s glories are proclaimed in all the scriptures. Never consider such glorification to be exaggerated praise. Agastya, Ananta, Brahmā, Śiva, and so on are always devoted to chanting the Name’s glories. Who can cross the ocean of those glories? Anyone who considers them exaggerated praise is wicked.

#### 6

    kṛṣṇa-nāmāvali nitya golokera dhana
    kalpita, prākṛta, bhāve—aparādhi-jana

Kṛṣṇa’s Names are the eternal wealth of Goloka. Anyone who considers Them imaginary or mundane is an offender.

#### 7

    nāme sarva-pāpa-kṣaya sarva-śāstre kaya
    sārā-dina pāpa kari sei bharasāya—
    emata durbuddhi yāra sei aparādhī
    māyā-pravañchita, duḥkha bhuñje niravadhi

All the scriptures declare that the Name destroys all sin. The wicked who sin all day long in expectation of this are offenders. They are deluded by māyā and suffer perpetually.

#### 8

    atulya śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāma pūrṇa-rasa-nidhi
    tā̐ra sama nā bhāviha śubha-karma ādi

Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s incomparable Name is a brimming reservoir of rasa. Chanting the Name should never be considered equal to pious worldly action (such as adhering to vows, practising renunciation, performing austerities, making sacrificial offerings, and so on).

#### 9

    nāme śraddhā-hina-jana—vidhātā vāñchita
    tāre nāma dāne aparādha suniśchita

Those who have no faith in the Name have been deceived by Providence. To give the Name to them is certainly an offence.

#### 10

    śuniyāo kṛṣṇa-nāma-māhātmya apāra
    ye prīti-rahita, sei narādhama chhāra
    ahaṁtā mamatā yāra antare bāhire
    śuddha kṛṣṇa-nāma tāra kabhu nāhi sphure

Those who remain devoid of love for Kṛṣṇa’s Name even after hearing His boundless glories are deplorable, fallen souls. The pure Name of Kṛṣṇa never reveals Himself to those who are internally and externally ridden with egotism and possessiveness.

#### 11

    ei daśa aparādha kariyā varjjana
    ye sujana kare harināma saṅkīrtana
    apūrva śrī-kṛṣṇa-prema labhya tāre haya
    nāma-prabhu tāra hṛde nitya vilasaya

Great souls who avoid these ten offences and engage in Hari-nām-saṅkīrtan attain unprecedented Śrī Kṛṣṇa-prema. The Name Himself plays within their hearts eternally.
