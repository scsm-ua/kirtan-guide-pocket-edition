### By Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    parama karuṇa     pah. dui jana nitāi gaurachandra
    saba avatāra-       sāra śiromaṇi kevala ānanda-kanda

Nitāi and Gaurachandra are the two most merciful Lords. They are the best, the crest-jewels, of all Avatārs and the only source of joy.

    (kevala-i ānanda-kanda)
    (nityānanda gaurachandra kevala-i ānanda-kanda)

They are the only source of joy. Nityānanda and Gaurachandra are the only source of joy.

    bhaja bhaja bhāi     chaitanya nitāi sudṛḍha viśvāsa kari’
    viṣaya chhāḍiyā      se rase majiyā mukhe bala hari hari

O brothers! Serve! Serve Śrī Śrī Chaitanya-Nitāi with firm faith! Leave aside worldly affairs, merge into this rasa, and chant aloud, ‘Hari! Hari!’

    (mukhe bala gaurahari)
    (viṣay-kathā parihari’   mukhe bala gaurahari) (grāmya-kathā parihari’  mukhe bala gaurahari)

Chant aloud, ‘Gaurahari’! Give up mundane talk and chant aloud ‘Gaurahari’! Give up village talk and chant aloud ‘Gaurahari’!

    dekha ore bhāi      tribhuvane nāi emana dayāla dātā

O brother! Look! There are no benefactors in the three worlds as merciful as Them.

    (eman dayāl ke vā āchhe)
    (nitāira gaurer mata eman dayāl ke vā āchhe)
    (mar kheyeo nām prema yāche eman dayāl ke vā āchhe)

Who else is so merciful? Who is as merciful as Nitāi and Gaura? They endure even being beaten, and yet They ask
Their aggressors to accept the Holy Name and divine love. Who else is so merciful?

    paśu pākhī jhure     pāṣāṇa vidare
    śuni yā̐ra guṇa-gāthā

Hearing of Their glory, birds and animals cry and stones melt.

#### 4

    saṁsāre majiyā      rahili paḍiyā se pade nahila āśa
    āpana karama     bhuñyāya śamana kahaye lochana dāsa

“Fallen and immersed in saṁsāra, I never aspired for Their feet. Now Yamarāj subjects me to my karma.” So says Lochan Dās.
