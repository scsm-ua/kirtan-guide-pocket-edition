# Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nityānander Dayā

### by Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    parama karuṇa    pah. dui jana
        nitāi gaurachandra
    saba avatāra-    sāra śiromaṇi
        kevala ānanda-kanda

Nitāi and Gaurachandra are the two most merciful Lords. They are the best, the crest-jewels, of all Avatārs and the only source of joy.

    (kevala-i ānanda-kanda)
    (nityānanda gaurachandra    kevala-i ānanda-kanda)

They are the only source of joy. Nityānanda and Gaurachandra are the only source of joy.

#### 2

    bhaja bhaja bhāi    chaitanya nitāi
        sudṛḍha viśvāsa kari’
    viṣaya chhāḍiyā    se rase majiyā
        mukhe bala hari hari

O brothers! Serve! Serve Śrī Śrī Chaitanya-Nitāi with firm faith! Leave aside worldly affairs, merge into this rasa, and chant aloud, ‘Hari! Hari!’

    (mukhe bala gaurahari)
    (viṣay-kathā parihari’    mukhe bala gaurahari)
    (grāmya-kathā parihari’    mukhe bala gaurahari)

#### 3

Chant aloud, ‘Gaurahari’! Give up mundane talk and chant aloud ‘Gaurahari’! Give up village talk and chant aloud ‘Gaurahari’!

    dekha ore bhāi    tribhuvane nāi
        emana dayāla dātā

O brother! Look! There are no benefactors in the three worlds as merciful as Them.

    (eman dayāl ke vā āchhe)
    (nitāira gaurer mata    eman dayāl ke vā āchhe)
    (mar kheyeo nām prema yāche    eman dayāl ke vā āchhe)

Who else is so merciful? Who is as merciful as Nitāi and Gaura? They endure even being beaten, and yet They ask Their aggressors to accept the Holy Name and divine love. Who else is so merciful?

    paśu pākhī jhure    pāṣāṇa vidare
        śuni yā̐ra guṇa-gāthā

Hearing of Their glory, birds and animals cry and stones melt.

#### 4

    saṁsāre majiyā    rahili paḍiyā
        se pade nahila āśa
    āpana karama    bhuñyāya śamana
        kahaye lochana dāsa

“Fallen and immersed in saṁsāra, I never aspired for Their feet. Now Yamarāj subjects me to my karma.” So says Lochan Dās.
