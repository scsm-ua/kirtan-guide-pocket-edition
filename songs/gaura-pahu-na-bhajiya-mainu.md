# Gaurā Pahu̐

### By Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    gaurā pahu̐ nā bhajiyā mainu
    prema ratana-dhana helāya hārāinu

Not serving Lord Gaurāṅga, I have died. Negligently I have lost the treasured jewel of divine love.

#### 2

    adhane yatana kari dhana teyāginu
    āpana karama-doṣe āpani ḍubinu

I have endeavoured for worthless things and rejected real wealth. I have drowned myself in my own sins.

#### 3

    sat-saṅga chhāḍi’ kainu asate vilāsa
    te-kāraṇe lāgila ye karma-bandha-phā̐sa

I have avoided the sādhus’ association and enjoyed with wicked people. Thus I have become bound in the noose of my karma.

#### 4

    viṣaya-viṣama-viṣa satata khāinu
    gaura-kīrtana rase magana nā hainu

I have constantly drunk the terrible poison of mundanity and never become immersed in the nectar of Śrī Gaurāṅga’s kīrtan.

#### 5

    kena vā āchhaye prāṇa ki sukha lāgiyā
    narottama dāsa kena nā gela mariyā

Why am I alive? For the sake of what happiness? Why has Narottam Dās not already died?
