# Emana Gaurāṅga vine nāhi āra

### By Śrīla Premānanda Dās

#### 1

        emana gaurāṅga vine nāhi āra
    hena avatāra    habe ki hayechhe
        hena prema parachāra

There is no one like Gaurāṅga! Has there ever been and will there ever be an Avatār who distributes divine love like Him?

    (hay ni ār habār nay re)

Oh! There has never been and never will be!

    duramati ati    patita pāṣaṇḍī
        prāṇe nā mārila kāre
    hari-nāma diye    hṛdaya śodhila
        yāchi giyā ghare ghare

He did not kill the fallen, wicked-hearted sinners; He gave them the Lord’s Name and purified their hearts. He went from house to house and begged them (to accept divine love).

    (ke nibi ke nibi bale)
    (yeche yeche yeche beḍāy)

“Who will take? Who will take? He goes out asking, asking, and asking.”

    bhava-viriñchira    vāñchhita ye prema
        jagate phelila ḍhāli
        (bhava viriñchira yā vāñchhā kare)
    kāṅgale pāiye    khāila nāchiye
        bājāiye karatāli

He freely distributed throughout the world divine love that is desired by even Brahmā and Śiva. The poor received and relished it, dancing and clapping their hands.

    (karatāli bājāiye)
    (gaurahari hari bale    karatāli bājāiye)

Clapping their hands! Chanting, “Gaurahari Hari!” and clapping their hands!

    hāsiye kā̐diye    preme gaḍāgaḍi
        pulake vyāpila aṅga
    chaṇḍāle brāhmaṇe    kare kolākuli
        kabe vā chhila e raṅga

Filled with divine love, they laughed, cried, and rolled about. Their body hair stood on end. The brāhmaṇs and the outcastes embraced. When were there ever such Pastimes?

    (chaṇḍāle brāhmaṇe    kare kolākuli
        e raṅga kabe vā chhila)

The brāhmaṇs and the outcastes embraced. When were there ever such Pastimes?

    ḍākiye hā̐kiye    khola-karatāle
        gāiye dhāiye phire
    dekhiyā śamana    tarāsa pāiye
        kapāṭa hānila dvāre

Howling and calling out, they sang and ran about with mṛdaṅgas and kartāls. Seeing this, Yamarāj became afraid and closed his doors and shutters.

    (bhaja bhaja gaurahari yā̐ra nāme śamaṇa palāy)

Serve! Serve Gaurahari! Yamarāj flees from His Name.

    e tina bhuvana    ānande bharila
        uṭhila maṅgala-sora

The three worlds filled with joy, and an auspicious tumult arose.

    (ānander ār sīmā nāi re)
    (gauraharir āgamane    ānander ār sīmā nāi re)
    (nirānanda dūre gela    ānander ār sīmā nāi re)
    (gauraharir āgamane    premānander udaya hala)
    (premānander udaya hala    sabāi mile haribola)

There is no limit to our joy! By Gaurahari’s arrival, there is no limit to our joy! All unhappiness has gone away, and there is no limit to our joy! By Gaurahari’s arrival, the joy of divine love has arisen, and everyone together chants “Hari!”

    kahe premānanda    emana gaurāṅge
        rati nā janmila mora

Premānanda says, “I never developed attachment to Lord Gaurāṅga.”

    (āmār rati-mati hala nā ye)
    (eman dayāl prabhu avatāre, āmār rati-mati hala nā re)
    (eman dayāl prabhu esechhila, āmār rati-mati hala nā re)
    (gaurahari hari bala)

I never developed attachment. I never developed attachment to this most merciful Lord. This most merciful Lord has come, but I have never developed attachment to Him. Oh! Chant, “Gaurahari!”
