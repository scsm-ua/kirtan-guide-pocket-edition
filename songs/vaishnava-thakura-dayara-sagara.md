# Śrī Vaiṣṇava-mahimā-gīti

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    (ohe) vaiṣṇava ṭhākura    dayāra sāgara
        e dāse karuṇā kari
    diyā pada-chāyā    śodha he āmāya
        tomāra charaṇa dhari

O worshippable Vaiṣṇava, ocean of grace, be merciful to this servant. Give me the shade of your feet and purify me. I clasp your feet.

#### 2

    chhaya vega dami’    chhaya doṣa śodhi’
        chhaya guṇa deha’ dāse
    chhaya sat-saṅga    deha’ he āmāre
        basechhi saṅgera āśe

Subjugate the six urges, rectify the six defects, and bestow the six good qualities upon this servant. Grant me the six kinds of good association. I have sat at your feet, desiring that association.

#### 3

    ekākī āmāra    nāhi pāya bala
        hari-nāma-saṅkīrtane
    tumi kṛpā kari    śraddhā-bindu diyā
        deha’ kṛṣṇa-nāma-dhane

Alone I do not have the ability to properly chant the Lord’s Name. Mercifully give me a drop of faith and bestow upon me the wealth of Kṛṣṇa’s Name.

#### 4

    kṛṣṇa se tomāra    kṛṣṇa dite pāra
        tomāra śakati āchhe
    āmi ta’ kāṅgāla    ‘kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa’ bali
        dhāi tava pāchhe pāchhe

Kṛṣṇa is yours. You can give Kṛṣṇa. You have that power. I am very poor. Calling, ‘Kṛṣṇa!’ ‘Kṛṣṇa!’, I run after you.

    (āmi) (dhāi tava pāchhe pāchhe)
    (kṛṣṇa dhana pābar āśe    dhāi tava pāchhe pāchhe)
    (tumi dile kṛṣṇa dite pāra)
    (kṛṣṇa tomār hṛdayer dhan    tumi dileo dite pāra)
    (kṛṣṇa debār śakti-dhara    tumi dileo dite pāra)

I run after you. I run after you in hope of attaining the wealth of Kṛṣṇa. If you desire to give Kṛṣṇa, you can give Him. If you desire to give, you can give. Kṛṣṇa is the wealth of your heart. You have the power to give Kṛṣṇa. If only you desire to give Kṛṣṇa, you can give Him.
