# Mānasa Deha Geha

### By Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    mānasa, deha, geha, yo kichhu mora
    arpilu̐ tuyā pade nanda-kiśora!

I have offered my mind, my body, my household, and whatever else may be mine at Your feet, O Nanda Kiśor!

#### 2

    sampade vipade jīvane-maraṇe
    dāy mama gelā tuyā o-pada varaṇe

In good times and in bad, in life and in death, all my responsibility has gone away by embracing Your feet.

#### 3

    mārabi rākhabi—yo ichhā tohārā
    nitya-dāsa prati tuyā adhikārā

Kill me or protect me as You wish. You have full authority over Your eternal servant.

#### 4

    janmāobi maye ichhā yadi tora
    bhakta-gṛhe jani janma ha-u mora

If You desire that I take birth again, let me do so in the home of Your devotee.

#### 5

    kīṭa-janma ha-u yathā tuyā dāsa
    bahir-mukha brahma-janme nāhi āśa

Let me be born again even as a worm, so long as I can remain Your servant. I have no desire to be born even as Brahmā if I will be averse to You.

#### 6

    bhukti-mukti-spṛhā vihīna ye bhakta
    labha-ite tā̐ka saṅga anurakta

I long to attain the association of devotees who are completely free from all desire for selfish enjoyment and liberation.

#### 7

    janaka, jananī, dayita, tanaya
    prabhu, guru, pati—tuhu̐ sarva-maya

Father, mother, lover, son, Lord, Guru, and husband—You are everything to me.

#### 8

    bhakati-vinoda kahe, śuna kāna!
    rādhā-nātha! tuhu̐ hāmāra parāṇa

Bhakti Vinod says, “Please listen, O Kān! O Rādhānāth! You are my life and soul.”
