    yaśomatī-nandana  vraja-vara-nāgara gokula-rañjana kāna
    gopī-parāṇa-dhana  madana-manohara kāliya-damana vidhāna

Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is known as Kān, is Yaśodā’s darling son, Vraja’s paramour, Gokula’s delight, the gopīs’ life and wealth, the enchanter of Cupid, and the conqueror of Kālīya.

    amala hari-nāma amiya-vilāsā vipina-purandara  navīna nāgara-vara
    vaṁśī-vadana suvāsā

His Names and nectarean Pastimes are all transcendental. He is the king of Vraja’s forests and the best of young paramours. He beautifully plays the flute.

    vraja-jana-pālana  asura-kula-nāśana nanda-godhana-rākhoyālā
    govinda mādhava    navanīta-taṣkara sundara nanda-gopālā

He is the guardian of Vraja’s residents, the destroyer of the demons, and the keeper of Nanda’s cows. He is known as ‘Govinda’—He who nourishes the cows, senses, Vedas, and world—and ‘Mādhava’—Śrī Rādhā’s consort. He is Nanda’s beautiful cowherd boy and a butter thief.

    yamunā-taṭa-chara  gopī-vasana-hara rāsa-rasika kṛpāmaya
    śrī-rādhā-vallabha vṛndāvana-naṭa-vara bhakativinod-āśraya

He is a spy on the Yamunā’s banks and the stealer of the gopīs’ garments. He is the relisher of the rāsa-līlā and the embodiment of mercy. He is Śrī Rādhā’s beloved, Vṛndāvan’s great dancer, and Bhakti Vinod’s shelter.
