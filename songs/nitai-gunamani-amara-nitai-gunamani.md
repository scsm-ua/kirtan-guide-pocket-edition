Nitāi, the jewel of all good qualities, my Nitāi, the jewel of all good qualities, brought a flood of divine love and inundated the earth.

    ḍubila bhakata-gaṇa dīna-hīna bhāse

Nitāi brought a flood of divine love to the land of Gauḍa. The devotees immersed themselves in it, but the unfortunate floated on its surface.

The sinful, unfortunate, and fallen did not desire this divine love, which is difficult for even Brahmā to attain, yet Nitāi begged them to accept it.

Nitāi cut a canal into the sealed ocean of mercy and a flood of nectarean divine love spread to every home.
