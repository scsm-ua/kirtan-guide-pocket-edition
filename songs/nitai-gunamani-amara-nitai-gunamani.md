# Nitāi guṇamaṇi āmāra

### by Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    nitāi guṇamaṇi āmāra nitāi guṇamaṇi
    āniyā premera vanyā bhāsāla avanī

Nitāi, the jewel of all good qualities, my Nitāi, the jewel of all good qualities, brought a flood of divine love and inundated the earth.

#### 2

    prema-vanyā laye nitāi āila gauḍa-deśe
    ḍubila bhakata-gaṇa dīna-hīna bhāse

Nitāi brought a flood of divine love to the land of Gauḍa. The devotees immersed themselves in it, but the unfortunate floated on its surface.

#### 3

    dīna-hīna patita pāmara nāhi bāchhe
    brahmāra durlabha prema sabākāre yāche

The sinful, unfortunate, and fallen did not desire this divine love, which is difficult for even Brahmā to attain, yet Nitāi begged them to accept it.

#### 4

    ābaddha karuṇā-sindhu kāṭiyā muhāna
    ghare ghare bule prema-amiyāra vāna

Nitāi cut a canal into the sealed ocean of mercy and a flood of nectarean divine love spread to every home.

#### 5

    lochan bale hena nitāi yebā nā bhajila
    jāniyā śuniyā sei ātma-ghātī haila

Lochan Dās says, “Anyone who did not serve Nitāi knowingly committed suicide.”
