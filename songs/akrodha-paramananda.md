# Akrodha paramānanda

### By Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    akrodha paramānanda nityānanda rāya
    abhimāna-śūnya nitāi nagare beḍāya

The anger-less, prideless, supremely joyful Nityānanda Rāy wanders throughout the towns.

#### 2

    adhama patita jīver dvāre dvāre giyā
    hari-nāma mahāmantra dena bilāiyā

Going from door to door to the homes of the lowly and fallen souls, He distributes the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra.

#### 3

    yāre dekhe tāre kahe dante tṛṇa dhari’
    āmāre kiniyā laha bhaja gaurahari

With straw between His teeth, He says to whoever He sees, “Purchase Me: simply serve Gaurahari.”

#### 4

    eta bali’ nityānanda bhūme gaḍi yāya
    sonāra parvata yena dhūlāte loṭāya

Saying this, Nityānanda rolls on the ground like a golden mountain rolling in the dust.

#### 5

    hena avatāre yāra rati nā janmila
    lochan bale sei pāpī ela āra gela

Lochan Dās says of one who has not developed attachment to this Avatār, “Such a sinner simply came and went.”

    (yāoyā āsā sār ha-ila)
    (nitāi-charaṇ nā bhajila    yāoyā āsā sār ha-ila)

“They simply came and went. Those who did not serve Nitāi’s feet simply came and went (took birth and died uselessly).”
