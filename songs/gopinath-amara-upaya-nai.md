#### 1

        gopīnāth, āmāra upāya nāi
    tumi kṛpā kari    āmāre la-ile
        saṁsāre uddhāra pāi

O Gopīnāth, I have no way out. Only if You mercifully take me will I be delivered from this world.

#### 2

        gopīnāth, paḍechhi māyāra phere
    dhana, dārā, suta    ghirechhe āmāre
        kāmete rekhechhe jere

O Gopīnāth, I have fallen into Māyā’s perils. Wealth, wife, and children have surrounded me, and lust has ruined me.

#### 3

        gopīnāth, mana ye pāgala mora
    nā māne śāsana    sadā achetana
        viṣaye rayechhe bhora

O Gopīnāth, my mind is crazy and does not submit to discipline. It is always senseless and has remained engrossed in mundanity.

#### 4

        gopīnāth, hāra ye menechhi āmi
    aneka yatana    ha-ila viphala
        ekhana bharasā tumi

O Gopīnāth, I have accepted defeat. All of my endeavours were useless. Now You are my hope.

#### 5

        gopīnāth, kemane ha-ibe gati
    prabala indriya    vaśī-bhūta mana
        nā chhāḍe viṣaya-rati

O Gopīnāth, how shall I progress? My mind is controlled by my powerful senses and does not abandon its attachment to mundanity.

#### 6

        gopīnāth, hṛdaye vasiyā mora
    manake śamiyā    laha nija-pāne
        ghuchibe vipada ghora

O Gopīnāth, sit down in my heart, subdue my mind, and bring me towards You. Dispel all danger and darkness.

#### 7

        gopīnāth, anātha dekhiyā more
    tumi hṛṣīkeśa    hṛṣīka damiyā
        tāra’ he saṁsṛti-ghore

O Gopīnāth, You are the Lord of the senses. Seeing me so helpless subdue my senses and deliver me from this dark world.

#### 8

        gopīnāth, galāya legechhe phā̐sa
    kṛpā-asi dhari’    bandhana chhediyā
        vinode karaha dāsa

O Gopīnāth, a noose has been tied around my neck. Taking up the sword of Your mercy, cut away this bondage and make Bhakti Vinod Your humble servant.

    (he govinda! gopīnātha!)
    (ei bār āmāy dayā kara    he govinda! gopīnātha!)
    (bahu janme aparādhī    he govinda! gopīnātha!)
    (lakṣa lakṣa janam gela    he govinda! gopīnātha!)
    (śrī charaṇe śaraṇ nilām    he govinda! gopīnātha!)
    (śrī charaṇe sevā diyā    he govinda! gopīnātha!)

O Govinda! O Gopīnāth! This time be merciful. I have been an offender for many births. Million of births have passed. Give me the shade of Your feet. I have surrendered at Your feet. Give me the service of Your feet. O Govinda! O Gopīnāth!
