# Goptṛtve Varaṇa

    ki jāni ki bale    tomāra dhāmete
        ha-inu śaraṇāgata
    tumi dayāmaya    patita-pāvana
        patita-tāraṇe rata

I do not know by what force I have taken shelter within Your abode. Surely it is by Your mercy alone, for You are ever seeking the purification and deliverance of the fallen souls.

    bharasā āmāra    ei mātra nātha!
        tumi ta’ karuṇā-maya
    tava dayā pātra    nāhi mora sama
        avaśya ghuchāre bhaya

O Lord! You are merciful. This is my sole hope. There is no one who needs Your mercy more than I. Certainly You will dispel all my fear.

#### 3

    āmāre tārite    kāhāra śakati
        avanī-bhitare nāhi
    dayāla ṭhākura!    ghoṣaṇā tomāra
        adhama pāmare trāhi

There is no one on earth who has the power to deliver me. O merciful Lord! It is Your declaration that You deliver the lowest, most sinful persons.

#### 4

    sakala chhāḍiyā    āsiyāchhi āmi
        tomāra charaṇe nātha!
    āmi nitya-dāsa    tumi pālayitā
        tumi goptā, jagannātha!

Abandoning everything, I have come to Your feet, O Lord! I am Your eternal servant, and You are my maintainer and protector, O Lord of the universe!

#### 5

    tomāra sakala    āmi mātra dāsa
        āmāra tāribe tumi
    tomāra charaṇa    karinu varaṇa
        āmāra nahi ta’ āmi

Everything is Yours. I am only a servant. Certainly You will deliver me. I have embraced Your feet and no longer belong to myself.

#### 6

    bhakati-vinoda    kā̐diya śaraṇa
        la’yechhe tomāra pāya
    kṣami’ aparādha    nāme ruchi diyā
        pālana karahe tāya

Weeping, Bhakti Vinod takes shelter at Your feet. Forgiving his offences and giving him a taste for the Name, kindly maintain him.
