#### 1

    udila aruṇa pūrava-bhāge
    dvija-maṇi gorā amani jāge
    bhakata-samūha la-iyā sāthe
        (gorā) gelā nagara-vrāje

The sun arises in the east, and the jewel of the brāhmaṇs, Śrī Gorāchā̐d, awakes. Taking His devotees with Him, He goes out about the town.

#### 2

    ‘tāthai tāthai’ bājala khola
    ghana ghana tāhe jhā̐jera rola
    preme ḍhala ḍhala sonāra aṅga
        (gorār) charaṇe nūpura bāje

The mṛdaṅgas resound ‘tāthai tāthai’ to the beat of the cymbals as Gaurasundar’s golden form sways with ecstatic love and His footbells jingle.

#### 3

    mukunda mādhava yādava hari
    balena bala re vadana bhari’
    michhe nida-vaśe gela re rāti
        divasa śarīra sāje

He calls out, “Chant aloud Mukunda, Mādhava, Yādava, Hari! Uselessly you pass the night asleep and the day decorating your body.

#### 4

    emana durlabha mānava-deha
    pāiyā ki kara bhāvanā keha
    ebe nā bhajile yaśodā-suta
        charame paḍibe lāje

“Having attained this rare human body, what are you thinking? If you do not serve Kṛṣṇa now, lastly you will fall into shame.

#### 5

    udita tapana ha-ile asta
    dina gela bali’ ha-ibe vyasta
    tabe kena ebe alasa ha-i’
        nā bhaja hṛdaya-rāje

“When the shining sun sets, you become busy, considering that the day has passed. So why are you being lazy now? Why don’t you serve the Lord of your heart?

#### 6

    jīvana anitya jānaha sāra
    tāhe nānā-vidha vipada-bhāra
    nāmāśraya kari’ yatane tumi
        thākaha āpana kāje

“Understand the essence: life is temporary and filled with all sorts of adversity. Carefully taking shelter of the Name, engage in your work.”

#### 7

    kṛṣṇa-nāma-sudhā kariyā pāna
    juḍāo bhakati-vinoda-prāṇa
    nāma vinā kichhu nāhika āra
        chaudda-bhuvana-mājhe

Drink the nectar of Kṛṣṇa’s Name and soothe Bhakti Vinod’s soul. There is nothing to be had but the Name in all the fourteen worlds.

#### 8

    jīvera kalyāṇa-sādhana-kāma
    jagate āsi’ e madhura nāma
    avidyā-timira-tapana-rūpe
        hṛd-gagane virāje

Desiring to bless all souls, the Lord’s sweet Name comes to this world and arises like the Sun within the sky of the heart to dispel the darkness of ignorance.
