# Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam

### by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu

    cheto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ
    śreyaḥ-kairava-chandrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam
    ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtāsvādanaṁ
    sarvātma-snapanaṁ paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam

Śrī Kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtan cleanses the mirror of consciousness, extinguishes the raging forest fire of material existence, shines moonlight on the evening lotus of good fortune, is the life of divine knowledge, expands the ocean of ecstasy, is the taste of full nectar at every moment, and soothes the entire self. May Śrī Kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtan be supremely victorious!

    nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis
    tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ
    etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavan mamāpi
    durdaivam īdṛśam ihājani nānurāgaḥ

O Lord, You have manifested Your numerous Names, placed all of Your power within Them, and made no rules regarding the time for remembering Them. Such is Your great mercy. My misfortune, however, is that I have no attachment to Your Names.

    tṛṇād api sunīchena taror iva sahiṣṇunā
    amāninā mānadena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ

The Lord’s Name is to be chanted always, with more humility than a blade of grass, tolerance like that of a tree, respect for everyone, and without desire for respect from anyone.

    na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ
    kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye
    mama janmani janmanīśvare
    bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi

O Lord of the universe, I do not desire wealth, followers, beautiful women, or erudition (dharma, artha, kāma, or mokṣa). Birth after birth, I desire only unconditional devotion to You.

    ayi nanda-tanuja kiṅkaraṁ
    patitaṁ māṁ viṣame bhavāmbudhau
    kṛpayā tava pāda-paṅkaja-
    sthita-dhūlī-sadṛśaṁ vichintaya

O Kṛṣṇa, Your servant has fallen into the terrible ocean of this world. Mercifully consider me a speck of dust at Your lotus feet.

    nayanaṁ galad-aśru-dhārayā
    vadanaṁ gadgada-ruddhayā girā
    pulakair nichitaṁ vapuḥ kadā
    tava nāma-grahaṇe bhaviṣyati

When will tears stream from my eyes, my voice falter, and the hair on my body stand on end as I call Your Name?

    yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa chakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam
    śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me

O Govinda, in separation from You, a moment feels like an age, tears pour from my eyes, and the world is void.

    āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām
    adarśanān marma-hatāṁ karotu vā
    yathā tathā vā vidadhātu lampaṭo
    mat-prāṇa-nāthas tu sa eva nāparaḥ

That debauchee may tightly embrace this maidservant, or He may leave me and break my heart. He may do as He likes, but He alone is the Lord of my heart.
