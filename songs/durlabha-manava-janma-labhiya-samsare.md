# Durlabha mānava-janma

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    durlabha mānava-janma labhiyā saṁsāre
    kṛṣṇa nā bhajinu duḥkha kahiba kāhāre?

I attained a human birth, which is most rare in this world, but did not serve Kṛṣṇa. To whom shall I express my sorrow?

#### 2

    ‘saṁsāra’ ‘saṁsāra’ kari’ michhe gela kāla
    lābha nā ha-ila kichhu, ghaṭila jañjāla

Living life after life in this mundane world, my time has passed in vain. I have not gained anything. I have only suffered.

#### 3

    kisera saṁsāra ei chhāyābāji prāya
    ihāte mamatā kari vṛthā dina yāya

What sort of world is this? It is like a shadow play. Attaching myself to it, my days pass by in vain.

#### 4

    e deha patana ha’le ki rabe āmāra?
    keha sukha nāhi dibe putra paribāra

When this body drops dead, what will remain ‘mine’? Upon death neither my sons nor my family will give me any satisfaction.

#### 5

    gardabhera mata āmi kari pariśrama
    kāra lāgi’ eta kari, nā ghuchila bhrama

I toil laboriously like an ass. For whom am I doing this? Still my illusion has not been dispelled.

#### 6

    dina yāya michhā kāje, niśā nidrā-vaśe
    nāhi bhāvi maraṇa nikaṭe āchhe vase

My days pass in meaningless labour, and my nights pass in sleep. I never consider that death is sitting nearby.

#### 7

    bhāla manda khāi, heri, pari, chintā-hīna
    nāhi bhāvi, e deha chhāḍiba kona dina

I eat luxuriously, look around, and dress carelessly, never considering that one day I will leave this body.

#### 8

    deha-geha-kalatrādi-chintā avirata
    jāgichhe hṛdaye mora buddhi kari hata

Constant thoughts of my body, home, wife, and so on, arise in my heart and spoil my intelligence.

#### 9

    hāya, hāya! nāhi bhāvi—anitya e saba
    jīvana vigate kothā rahibe vaibhava?

Alas! Alas! I never considered that all of these things are temporary. When my soul departs, where will all these opulences remain?

#### 10

    śmaśāne śarīra mama paḍiyā rahibe
    vihaṅga-pataṅga tāya vihāra karibe

My body will be laid to rest at the crematorium. There birds and insects will enjoy it.

#### 11

    kukkura sṛgāla saba ānandita ha’ye
    mahotsava karibe āmāra deha la’ye

Dogs and jackals will happily have a festival with my body.

#### 12

    ye dehera ei gati, tāra anugata
    saṁsāra-vaibhava āra bandhu-jana yata

This is the fate of my body, its effects, material wealth, and all of my companions.

#### 13

    ataeva māyā-moha chhāḍi buddhimāna
    nitya-tattva kṛṣṇa-bhakti karuna sandhāna

So, intelligent souls! Abandon Māyā’s illusion and search for the eternal truth: devotion to Kṛṣṇa.
