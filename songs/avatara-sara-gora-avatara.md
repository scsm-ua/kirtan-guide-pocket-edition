# Avatāra Sāra

### By Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    avatāra sāra        gorā avatāra kena nā bhajili tā̐re
    kari’ nīre vāsa       gela nā piyāsa
    āpana karama phere

Śrī Gaura Avatār is the best of all Avatārs. Why don’t you serve Him? O mind, you resided beside water, but did not quench your thirst. You returned to your selfishness.

#### 2

    kaṇṭakera taru    sadāi sevili (mana) amṛta pā’bāra āśe
    prema-kalpataru   śrī gaurāṅga āmāra tāhāre bhavili viṣe

O mind, desiring to drink nectar, you constantly chewed thorned wood (and mistook the blood in your mouth for nectar). My Lord Gaurāṅga is a wish-fulfilling tree of divine love, but you considered Him to be poison.

#### 3

    saurabhera āśe   palāśa ś.kili (mana) nāsāte paśila kīṭa
    ‘ikṣu-daṇḍa’ bhāvi’  kāṭha chuṣili (mana) kemane pāibi miṭha

O mind, seeking a fragrance, you smelled the odourless palāśa flower, and insects entered your nose. O mind, considering it sugarcane, you sucked dry wood. How will you taste sweetness in this way?

#### 4

    ‘hāra’ baliyā     galāya parili (mana)
    śamana kiṅkara sāpa
    ‘śītala’ baliyā     āguna pohāli (mana) pāili vajara-tāpa

O mind, considering it a necklace, you wore death’s attendant serpent around your neck. O mind, considering it to be cooling, you embraced fire and received a scorching burn.

#### 5

    saṁsāra bhajili   śrī-gaurāṅga bhulili nā śunili sādhura kathā
    iha-parakāla    dukāla khoyāli (mana) khāili āpana māthā

You served your family (mundane ends), forgot Śrī Gaurāṅga, and never listened to the sādhus’ words. O mind, you wasted both this life and your next life. You depraved yourself.
