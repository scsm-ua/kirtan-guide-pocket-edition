# Rūpa-Kīrtan

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    janama saphala tā’ra    kṛṣṇa-daraśana yā’ra
        bhāgye ha-iyāchhe eka-bāra
    vikaśiyā hṛn-nayana    kari’ kṛṣṇa daraśana
        chhāḍe jīva chitera vikāra

The birth of one who, by good fortune, has once seen Kṛṣṇa is successful. Developing the heart’s eyes and seeing Kṛṣṇa, such a soul abandons all delusions.

#### 2

        vṛndāvana-keli chatur vanamālī
    tribhaṅga-bhaṅgimā-rūpa    vaṁśī-dhārī aparūpa
        rasamaya nidhi, guṇa-śālī

Kṛṣṇa is expert at play in Vṛndāvan. He wears a forest garland, poses bent in three places, and plays the flute perfectly. He is a reservoir of rasa and possesses all qualities.

#### 3

    varṇa nava jaladhara    śire śikhi-pichchha-vara
        alakā tilaka śobhā pāya
    paridhāne pīta-vāsa    vadane madhura hāsa
        hena rūpa jagat mātāya

His complexion is the colour of a fresh rain cloud. His forehead is adorned with tilak, curling locks, and a fine peacock feather. He wears yellow garments and a sweet smile on His face. His form enchants the world.

#### 4

    indra-nīla jini    kṛṣṇa-rūpa-khāni
        heriyā kadamba-mūle
    mana uchāṭana    nā chale charaṇa
        saṁsāra gelāma bhule

Beholding Kṛṣṇa’s form, which surpasses the beauty of a sapphire, beneath a kadamba, my heart was overwhelmed. My feet could not move. I forgot the world.

#### 5

        (sakhī he) sudhāmaya se rūpa mādhurī
    dekhile nayana    haya achetana
        jhare premamaya vāri

O friend! When I saw the beauty of Kṛṣṇa’s nectarean form, I fainted and shed tears of divine love.

#### 6

    kibā chūḍā śire    kibā vaṁśī kare
        kibā se tribhaṅga ṭhāma
    charaṇa-kamale    amiyā uchhale
        tāhāte nūpura dāma

What a crown on His head! What a flute in His hand! What a threefold pose! Nectar surged from His lotus feet, which were adorned with tinkling anklets.

#### 7

    sadā āśā kari    bhṛṅga-rūpa dhari
        charaṇa-kamale sthāna
    anāyāse pāi    kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāi
        āra nā bhajiba āna

I eternally desire to take the form of a bee, easily attain a place at Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, and sing His glories. I will never serve anyone else.
