# Siddhi-Lālasā

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    kabe gaura-vane    suradhunī-taṭe
        ‘hā rādhe hā kṛṣṇa’ ba’le
    kā̐diyā beḍāba    deha-sukha chhāḍi’
        nānā latā-taru-tale

When will I abandon all bodily pleasures and wander along the banks of the Ganges beneath the trees and creepers in Śrī Gaurasundar’s forests, crying and calling out, “O Rādhā! O Kṛṣṇa!”?

#### 2

    śva-pacha-gṛhete    māgiyā khāiba
        piba sarasvatī-jala
    puline puline    gaḍāgaḍi diba
        kari’ kṛṣṇa-kolāhala

When will I eat by begging food from the houses of dogeating outcasts and drink the water of the river Saraswatī? When will I roll about on the banks of the Ganges and uproariously call out, “Kṛṣṇa!”?

#### 3

    dhāma-vāsī jane    praṇati kariyā
        māgiba kṛpāra leśa
    vaiṣṇava-charaṇa-    reṇu gāya mākhi
        dhari’ avadhūta-veśa

When will I bow down before the residents of Śrī Gaurasundar’s abode and beg for a particle of their mercy? When will I wear the garb of an avadhūt and smear my body with the dust of the devotees’ feet?

#### 4

    gauḍa-vraja-vane    bheda nā heriba
        ha-iba varaja-vāsī
    dhāmera svarūpa    sphuribe nayane
        ha-iba rādhāra dāsī

When will I see no difference between the residents of Gauḍa and the residents of Vraja, and become a resident of Vraja? When will the true nature of the Lord’s abode manifest before my eyes? When will I become Śrī Rādhā’s maidservant?
