He is Gadādhar’s joy, and Nitāi’s life and wealth. He is worshipped by Advaita Āchārya. He is known as Nimāi, and is the maintainer of the universe. He is Śrīvās Ṭhākur’s Lord, and He steals the devotees’ hearts.

He is the purifier of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭāchārya and the deliverer of Mahārāj Pratāparudra. He is the maintainer of Rāmānanda Rāy and the hero of all. He is the guardian of Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī and the joy of Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī. He is the delight of Hari Dās Ṭhākur and is perfectly sober.

He is absorbed in Vraja’s rasas. He is the dispeller of misconception, lust, and deceit. He is the maintainer of the pure devotees and the dispeller of dry knowledge. He is the eradicator of pseudo-devotion and the reservoir of all pleasure.
