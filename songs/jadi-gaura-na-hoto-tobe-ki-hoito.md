# Yadi Gaura nā ho’to

### by Śrīla Vāsudev Ghoṣ

#### 1

    yadi, gaura nā ha’ta    tabe ki ha-ita
        kemane dharitām de
    rādhāra mahimā    prema-rasa-sīmā
        jagate jānāta ke?

If Śrī Gaura had not come, what would have happened? How would we have maintained our lives? Who would have revealed to the world Śrī Rādhā’s glory and the extremes of Her ecstatic divine love?

    (rādhār mahimā ke jānata)
    (gaura yadi nā āsita rādhār mahimā ke jānata)

Who would have known Śrī Rādhā’s glory? If Śrī Gaura would not have come, who would have known Śrī Rādhā’s glory?

    madhura vṛndā-    vipina mādhurī
        praveśa chāturī sāra
    varaja-yuvatī    bhāvera bhakati
        śakati ha-ita kāra?

Who would have the great expertise needed to enter into the sweetness of sweet Vṛndāvan? Who would have any qualification for the Vraja-gopīs’ ecstatic devotion?

    gāo punaḥ punaḥ    gaurāṅgera guṇa
        sarala kariyā mana
    e bhava-sāgare    emana dayāla
        nā dekhiye eka-jana

Sing Gaurāṅga’s glories again and again, keeping your heart simple. In the ocean of this material world, no one has ever seen anyone so merciful.

    (āmi) gaurāṅga baliyā    nā genu galiyā
        kemane dharinu de
    vāsura-hiyā    pāṣāṇa diyā
        (vidhi) kemane gaḍiyāchhe

I chant ‘Gaurāṅga’, but have not melted (with love). How have I maintained this body? How has Providence made Vāsu a stone rather than a heart?
