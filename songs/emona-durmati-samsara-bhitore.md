    emana durmati     saṁsāra bhitare paḍiyā āchhinu āmi
    tava nija-jana      kona mahājane pāṭhāiyā dile tumi

O Lord! I am very wicked-minded and have fallen into this material world, but You have sent a great soul, Your associate (to rescue me).

    dayā kari more       patita dekhiyā kahila āmāre giyā
    ohe dīna-jana     śuna bhāla kathā ullasita ha’be hiyā

Seeing me so fallen and being merciful, he came to me and said, “O humble soul, listen to this wonderful message and your heart will rejoice.

#### 3

    tomāre tārite    śrī-kṛṣṇa-chaitanya navadvīpe avatāra
    tomā hena kata      dīna-hīna jane karilena bhava-pāra

“Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya has appeared in Nabadwīp to deliver you. He has brought many humble souls just like you to the shore of the ocean of material existence.

    vedera pratijñā      rākhibāra tare rukma-varṇa vipra-suta
    mahāprabhu nāme    nadīyā mātāya (mahāprabhu nāme    jagata mātāya)
    saṅge bhāi avadhūta

“To fulfil the prophecies of the Vedas, He has appeared with a golden complexion as a brāhmaṇ’s son bearing the name ‘Mahāprabhu’ and driven all of Nadia (all the world) mad with divine love in the company of His brother Nityānanda.

    nanda suta yini    chaitanya gosāñī nija-nāma kari’ dāna
    tārila jagat          tumi-o yāiyā laha nija paritrāṇa

“Śrī Chaitanya, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself, has distributed His own Name and delivered the world. Go also and accept your deliverance.”

    se kathā śuniyā    āsiyāchhi, nātha! tomāra charaṇa-tale
    bhakati-vinoda     kā̐diyā kā̐diyā āpana-kāhinī bale

O Lord, hearing this message, Bhakti Vinod has come to the soles of Your feet. Crying, he tells his story.
