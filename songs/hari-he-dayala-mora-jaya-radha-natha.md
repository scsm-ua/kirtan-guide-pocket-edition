O Lord! After wandering through many wombs, I have taken shelter of You. Be merciful and deliver this fallen soul by Your divine power.

You are the world’s cause and life. Without You, no one has anything, O Lover of Rādhā!

You are the world’s auspiciousness and master. O Lord! If You neglect me, what will be my fate?

I have understood that in this world there is no one but You to deliver this servant.
