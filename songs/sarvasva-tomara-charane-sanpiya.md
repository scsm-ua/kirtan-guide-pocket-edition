# Sarvasva tomāra

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    sarvasva tomāra,    charaṇe sa̐piyā,
        paḍechhi tomāra ghare
    tumi ta’ ṭhākura,    tomāra kukkura,
        baliyā jānaha more

I have offered everything at Your feet and taken shelter in Your home. You are my Master. Consider me Your dog.

#### 2

    bā̐dhiyā nikaṭe,    āmāre pālibe,
        rahiba tomāra dvāre
    pratīpa-janere,    āsite nā diba,
        rākhiba gaḍera pāre

You will tie me up nearby and maintain me. I will remain at Your doorstep. I will not allow any inimical persons to enter; I will keep them on the far side of Your moat.

#### 3

    tava nija-jana,    prasāda seviyā,
        uchchhiṣṭa rākhibe yāhā
    āmāra bhojana,    parama-ānande,
        prati-dina habe tāhā

Whatever remnants Your devotees leave behind after honouring Your prasād I will eat every day with great joy.

#### 4

    basiyā śuiyā,    tomāra charaṇa,
        chintiba satata āmi
    nāchite nāchite,    nikaṭe yāiba,
        yakhana ḍākibe tumi

While sitting up or lying down, I will always think of Your feet. I will come to You whenever You call me, dancing all the way.

#### 5

    nijera poṣana,    kabhu nā bhāviba,
        rahiba bhāvera bhare
    bhakati-vinoda,    tomāre pālaka,
        baliyā varaṇa kare

I will never think about my own maintenance; I will always remain within the shelter of loving attachment to You. Bhakti Vinod embraces You as his maintainer.
