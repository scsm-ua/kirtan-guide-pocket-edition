# Āmāra jīvana

### By Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    āmāra jīvana    sadā pāpe rata
        nāhika puṇyera leśa
    parere udvega    diyāchhi ye kata
        diyāchhi jīvere kleśa

My life is always engrossed in sin. There is not a trace of piety within it. I have caused others so much anxiety and trouble.

    nija sukha lāgi’    pāpe nāhi ḍari
        dayā-hīna svārtha-para
    para-sukhe duḥkhī    sadā mithya-bhāṣī
        para-duḥkha sukha-kara

I am never afraid to engage in sinful activities for the sake of my own happiness. I am merciless and selfish. I am a perpetual liar. I am saddened by the happiness of others and pleased by the sadness of others.

    aśeṣa kāmanā    hṛdi mājhe mora
        krodhī, dambha-parāyaṇa
    mada-matta sadā    viṣaye mohita
        hiṁsā-garva vibhūṣana

There are unlimited sinful desires within the core of my heart. I am angry and arrogant, always maddened with vanity, infatuated with mundanity, and ornamented with malice and pride.

#### 4

    nidrālasya hata    sukārye virata
        akārye udyogī āmi
    pratiṣṭhā lāgiyā    śāṭhya-ācharaṇa
        lobha-hata sadā kāmī

I am subdued by laziness and sleep, averse to performing good deeds, and eager to perform sinful deeds. I engage in deceitful behaviour in pursuit of prestige. I am ruined by greed and constantly covetous.

#### 5

    e hena durjana    sajjana-varjita
        aparādhi nirantara
    śubha-kārya-śūnya    sadānartha-manāḥ
        nānā duḥkhe jara jara

Such a sinner as I is shunned by devotees, and is a constant offender. I am devoid of virtuous motives, always intent upon evil, and racked by various miseries.

#### 6

    vārdhakye ekhana    upāya-vihīna
        tā’te dīna akiñchana
    bhakati-vinoda    prabhura charaṇe
        kare duḥkha nivedana

Now aged, I am devoid of any means of deliverance and thus destitute and distressed. Bhakti Vinod submits this remorseful confession at the Lord’s feet.
