### by Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj

#### 1

    jayare jayare jaya gaura-sarasvatī
    bhakativinodānvaya karuṇā murati

All glory to the voice of Śrī Gaurāṅga, the embodiment of Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur’s mercy, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur!

    prakāśile gaura-sevā bhūvana maṅgala
    bhakati-siddhānta śuddha prajñāna ujjvala

He manifested Śrī Gaurāṅga’s service for the upliftment of the world. His teaching of devotion is pure, brilliant, and enlightening.

#### 3

    rādhā-śyāma eka-tanu dakṣe gorā rāya
    bāme rādha madhye svayaṁ śyāma-gopa jaya

All glory to the combined form of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Śyām, Śrī Gaura Rāy, on the right, Śrī Rādhā on the left, and the dark cowherd boy Himself in the middle!

#### 4

    vraja-rasa nava-bhāve navadvīpe rāje
    udāre madhura rāga abhinava sāje

Vraja’s rasa manifests in a new way in Nabadwīp: madhurarasa dresses newly in benevolence.

#### 5

    mādhurya kaivalya rāga vrajera niryāsa
    prāpti parākāṣṭhā tāhe gaurāṅga vilāsa

Sweet divine love, Vraja’s essence, reaches its climax in Śrī Gaurāṅga’s Pastimes.

#### 6

    rādhā bhāva-kānti aṅgikari’ bhāla mate
    dakṣiṇe āsana rasa garimā dekhāte

Śrī Gaurāṅga earnestly embraces Śrī Rādhā’s heart and halo, and takes His place on the right to show His rasa’s glory.

#### 7

    rādhā-rasa-traya-svāda rahasya prayāsa
    nirakhi praphulla rādhā mukhe manda hāsa

Seeing Kṛṣṇa’s secret endeavour to taste Her threefold rasa, Rādhā is fulfilled and smiles gently.

#### 8

    madhye rahi’ vaṁśī-rave ghoṣe vaṁśī-dhara
    rādhāra sampade āmi gaurāṅga-sundara!

Remaining in the middle, the flute player declares with the song of His flute, “With Rādhā’s wealth, I am Gaurāṅgasundar!”

#### 9

    mad abhīṣṭha rūpa rādhāra hṛdaya mandire
    gaurāṅga bhajile suṣṭhu sphūrti pāya tāre

“If you serve Gaurāṅga, My form which is cherished in the temple of Rādhā’s heart will be fully revealed to you.”

#### 10

    nadīyā prakāśe mahāprabhu gaura-nidhi
    patita-pāvana deve milāila vidhi

Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu appeared in Nadia, and Providence combined the saviour of the fallen (the Kali-yuga-avatār) within Him.

#### 11

    e-rūpa ārati brahmā śambhu agochara
    gaura-bhakta kṛpā-pātra mātra siddhi sāra

This type of ārati is unknown to Brahmā and Śiva. Only a recipient of Śrī Gaurāṅga’s devotees’ mercy reaches such perfection.

#### 12

    śrī svarūpa, rāmānanda, rūpa, sanātana
    śrī raghu, jīvādi kṛpāya dekhe bhakta-jana

Devotees see this ārati by the mercy of Śrī Svarūp Dāmodar, Śrī Rāmananda Rāy, Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Sanātan, Śrī Raghunāth, Śrī Jīva, and their associates.

#### 13

    jaya guru-gaura-rādhā-govinda-sundara
    jaya dāo bhakta vṛnda nitya nirantara

All glory to Śrī Guru, Gaurāṅga, and Rādhā-Govindasundar! O devotees, glorify them always and forever!
