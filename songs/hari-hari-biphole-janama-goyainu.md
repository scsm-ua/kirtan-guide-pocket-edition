### by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

    hari hari!
        viphale janama goṅāinu
    manuṣya-janama pāiyā    rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā
        jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu

O Lord! My life has passed uselessly. I attained a human birth, but I did not serve Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Knowingly I drank poison.

    golokera prema-dhana    hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana
        rati nā janmila kena tāya
    saṁsāra-viṣānale    divā-niśi hiyā jvale
        juḍāite nā kainu upāya

Why didn’t I develop attachment to Hari-nām-saṅkīrtan, to Goloka’s divine love and wealth? My heart burns day and night in the poisonous fire of saṁsāra, yet I have not sought any way to relieve it.

    vrajendra-nandana yei    śachī-suta haila sei
        balarāma ha-ila nitāi
    dīna-hīna yata chhila    hari-nāme uddhārila
        tāra śākṣī jagāi mādhāi

Vrajendra Nandan became Śachī Suta and Balarām became Nitāi. They delivered all the fallen souls with the Holy Name. Jagāi and Mādhāi are evidence of this.

    hā hā prabhu nanda-suta    vṛṣabhānu-sutā-yuta
        karuṇā karaha ei-bāra
    narottama-dāsa kaya    nā ṭheliha rāṅgā pāya
        tomā vine ke āchhe āmāra

O Rādhā! O Lord Kṛṣṇa! Be merciful to me this time. Narottam Dās says, “Please don’t push me away from Your reddish feet. Without You, who do I have?”
