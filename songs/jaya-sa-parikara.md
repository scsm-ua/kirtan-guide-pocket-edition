    jaya śachī-nandana    sura-muni-vandana

    jaya hari-kīrtana-    nartanāvartana
        kali-mala-kartana jaya he

All glory to Śrī Śachī Nandan, who is worshipped by the demigods and sages! All glory to He who destroys all fear of material existence! All glory to the inaugurator of dancing and chanting the Lord’s Names! All glory to He who removes the contamination of Kali!

    nayana-purandara    viśvarūpa snehadhara
        viśvambhara viśvera kalyāṇa

        jaya priya kiṅkara īśāna

Śrī Śachī Nandan is the delight of everyone’s eyes and affectionate to His brother Viśvarūp. He is the maintainer of the world and the embodiment of its good fortune. All glory to Lakṣmī Priyā and Viṣṇu Priyā, who are dear to Viśvambhar’s heart! All glory to His dear servant Īśān!
