# Vaiṣṇava Vijñāpti

### by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ei-bāra karuṇā kara vaiṣṇava gosāi
    patita-pāvana tomā vine keha nāi

O worshippable Vaiṣṇava, be merciful to me this time. O saviour of the fallen, without you there is no one.

#### 2

    kāhāra nikaṭe gele pāpa dūre yāya
    emana dayāla prabhu kebā kothā pāya

If one comes to you, one’s sins go away. Where can such a merciful master be found?

#### 3

    gaṅgāra-paraśa ha-ile paśchāte pāvana
    darśane pavitra kara—ei tomāra guṇa

If the Ganges touches someone, he is later purified, but you purify souls simply by seeing them—such is your power.

#### 4

    hari-sthāne aparādhe tāre hari-nāma
    tomā-sthāne aparādhe nāhika eḍāna

If one offends the Lord, the Lord’s Name delivers him, but if one offends you, one has no salvation.

#### 5

    tomāra hṛdaye sadā govinda-viśrāma
    govinda kahena—mama vaiṣṇava parāṇa

Govinda always resides in your heart, and He says, “My devotees are My heart.”

#### 6

    prati janme kari āśā charaṇera dhūli
    narottame kara dayā āpnāra bali’

In every birth I aspire for the dust of your feet. Be merciful to Narottam, considering him your own.
