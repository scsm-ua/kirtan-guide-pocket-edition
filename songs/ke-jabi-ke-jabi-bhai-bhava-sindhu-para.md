# Ke yābi ke yābi

### By Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ke yābi ke yābi bhāi bhava-sindhu pāra dhanya kali-yuge re chaitanya-avatāra

Who will cross, O brother, who will cross the ocean of material existence? Oh! The fortune of this Age of Kali is the appearance of Śrī Chaitanya.

#### 2

    āmāra gaurāṅger ghāṭe ujānakheyā vaya kaḍipāti nāhi lāge amani pāra haya

At my Lord Gaurāṅga’s ghāṭ the upstream ferry runs without requesting any fare. Everyone crosses freely.

#### 3

    hari-nāmera tarīkhāni śrī-guru-kāṇḍārī
    saṅkīrtana-keroyāla du’bāhu pasāri

The Lord’s Names are the ferryboat, Śrī Guru is the captain, and the outstretched arms in the saṅkīrtan are the oars.

#### 4

    sarva-jīva uddhāra haila premera vātāse lochana paḍiyā raila karamera doṣe

All souls have thus been delivered by the winds of divine love. Only Lochan Dās has fallen and remained behind, as a result of his sins.
