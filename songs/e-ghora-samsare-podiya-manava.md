# E ghora saṁsāre

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    e ghora-saṁsāre    paḍiyā mānava
        nā pāya duḥkhera śeṣa
    sādhu-saṅga kari’    hari bhaje yadi
        tabe anta haya kleśa

A person who has fallen into this terrible world never ceases to suffer. If one associates with sādhus and serves Hari, however, one’s suffering comes to an end.

#### 2

    viṣaya anale    jvalichhe hṛdaya
        anale bāḍaye anala
    aparādha chhāḍi’    laya kṛṣṇa-nāma
        anale paḍaye jala

A fallen soul burns in the ever-increasing fire of mundanity. Avoiding offences, chant Kṛṣṇa’s Name. This pours water on the fire.

    nitāi chaitanya    charaṇa-kamale
        āśraya la-ila yei
    kāli dāsa bale    jīvane maraṇe
        āmāra āśraya sei

Kāli Dās says, “Anyone who has taken shelter of Nitāi and Chaitanya’s lotus feet is my shelter, in life and in death.”
