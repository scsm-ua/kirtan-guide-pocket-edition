# E ghora saṁsāre

    e ghora-saṁsāre    paḍiyā mānava nā pāya duḥkhera śeṣa
    sādhu-saṅga kari’    hari bhaje yadi tabe anta haya kleśa

A person who has fallen into this terrible world never ceases to suffer. If one associates with sādhus and serves Hari, however, one’s suffering comes to an end.

    viṣaya anale      jvalichhe hṛdaya anale bāḍaye anala
    aparādha chhāḍi’   laya kṛṣṇa-nāma anale paḍaye jala

A fallen soul burns in the ever-increasing fire of mundanity. Avoiding offences, chant Kṛṣṇa’s Name. This pours water on the fire.

    nitāi chaitanya     charaṇa-kamale
    āśraya la-ila yei
    kāli dāsa bale       jīvane maraṇe
    āmāra āśraya sei

Kāli Dās says, “Anyone who has taken shelter of Nitāi and Chaitanya’s lotus feet is my shelter, in life and in death.”
