# Vimala hema jini

### by Śrīla Vṛndāvan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    vimala hema jini    tanu anupama re!
        tāhe śobhe nānā phula-dāma
    kadamba keśara jini    ekaṭī pulaka re!
        tāra mājhe bindu bindu ghāma

His unparalleled form surpasses the purest gold! He is decorated with a garland of assorted flowers. His erect hairs surpass kadamba filaments! He is covered with beads of sweat.

    jini mada-matta hāti    gamana manthara ati
        bhāvāveśe ḍhuli ḍhuli yāya
    aruṇa-vasana chhavi    jini prabhātera ravi
        gorā-aṅge laharī khelāya

His slow movements surpass those of an intoxicated elephant. Rapt in ecstasy, He sways to and fro. The splendour of His saffron garments surpasses the morning sun. Waves play across His golden form.

    chalite nā pāre gorā-    chā̐d go̐sāñi re
        balite nā pāre ādha-bola
    bhāvete āveśa haiyā    hari hari bolāiyā
        āchaṇḍāle dhari’ deya kola

Lord Gorāchā̐d cannot move! He cannot speak! He simply stammers. Rapt in ecstasy, He induces outcastes to chant ‘Hari! Hari!’ and He embraces them.

    e sukha-sampada-kāle    gorā nā bhajinu hele
        hena pade nā karinu āśa
    śrī-kṛṣṇa-chaitanya-chandraṭhākura śrī-nityānanda
        guṇa gāya vṛndāvana dāsa

At this joyful, fortunate time, neglectfully I did not serve Gorāchā̐d or aspire for His feet. Vṛndāvan Dās sings the glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanyachandra and Ṭhākur Śrī Nityānanda.
