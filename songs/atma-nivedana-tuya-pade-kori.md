# Ātma-nivedana

### By Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ātma-nivedana      tuyā pade kari ha-inu parama sukhī
    duḥkha dūre gela     chintā nā rahila chaudike ānanda dekhi

Surrendering myself at Your feet, I have become completely happy. All my distress has gone away, I have no more anxiety, and I see joy in all directions.

#### 2

    aśoka-abhaya      amṛta-ādhāra tomāra charaṇa-dvaya
    tāhāte ekhana     viśrāma labhiyā chhāḍinu bhavera bhaya

Your feet are the abode of sorrowlessness, fearlessness, and nectar. Receiving shelter beneath them, I have abandoned all fear of material existence.

#### 3

    tomāra saṁsāre      kariba sevana nahiba phalera bhāgī
    tava sukha yāhe      kariba yatana ha’ye pade anurāgī

I will serve in Your home and will not become an enjoyer of the results. Lovingly attached to Your feet, I will carefully do whatever pleases You.

#### 4

    tomāra sevāya     duḥkha haya yata seo ta’ parama sukha
    sevā-sukha-duḥkha  parama sampada nāśaye avidyā-duḥkha

All the distress I encounter in Your service is also my great happiness. Both the distress and the happiness that come from serving You are my great fortune. They both destroy the distress of ignorance.

#### 5

    pūrva itihāsa      bhulinu sakala sevā-sukha pe’ye mane
    āmi ta’ tomāra       tumi ta’ āmāra ki kāja apara dhane

Feeling the happiness of Your service in my heart, I have completely forgotten all past history. I am Yours, and You are mine. What need is there for any other wealth?

#### 6

    bhakati-vinoda     ānande ḍubiyā
    tomāra sevāra tare
    saba cheṣṭā kare    tava ichhā-mata thākiyā tomāra ghare

Diving in the joy of Your service, Bhakti Vinod resides within Your home and performs all his endeavours in accordance with Your will.
