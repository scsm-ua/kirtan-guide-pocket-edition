# Ātma-nivedana

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ātma-nivedana    tuyā pade kari
        ha-inu parama sukhī
    duḥkha dūre gela    chintā nā rahila
        chaudike ānanda dekhi

Surrendering myself at Your feet, I have become completely happy. All my distress has gone away, I have no more anxiety, and I see joy in all directions.

#### 2

    aśoka-abhaya    amṛta-ādhāra
        tomāra charaṇa-dvaya
    tāhāte ekhana    viśrāma labhiyā
        chhāḍinu bhavera bhaya

Your feet are the abode of sorrowlessness, fearlessness, and nectar. Receiving shelter beneath them, I have abandoned all fear of material existence.

#### 3

    tomāra saṁsāre    kariba sevana
        nahiba phalera bhāgī
    tava sukha yāhe    kariba yatana
        ha’ye pade anurāgī

I will serve in Your home and will not become an enjoyer of the results. Lovingly attached to Your feet, I will carefully do whatever pleases You.

#### 4

    tomāra sevāya    duḥkha haya yata
        seo ta’ parama sukha
    sevā-sukha-duḥkha    parama sampada
        nāśaye avidyā-duḥkha

All the distress I encounter in Your service is also my great happiness. Both the distress and the happiness that come from serving You are my great fortune. They both destroy the distress of ignorance.

#### 5

    pūrva itihāsa    bhulinu sakala
        sevā-sukha pe’ye mane
    āmi ta’ tomāra    tumi ta’ āmāra
        ki kāja apara dhane

Feeling the happiness of Your service in my heart, I have completely forgotten all past history. I am Yours, and You are mine. What need is there for any other wealth?

#### 6

    bhakati-vinoda    ānande ḍubiyā
        tomāra sevāra tare
    saba cheṣṭā kare    tava ichhā-mata
        thākiyā tomāra ghare

Diving in the joy of Your service, Bhakti Vinod resides within Your home and performs all his endeavours in accordance with Your will.
