# Śuddha-bhakata

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    śuddha-bhakata-    charaṇa-reṇu
        bhajana-anukūla
    bhakata-sevā    parama-siddhi
        prema-latikāra mūla

The dust of pure devotees’ feet is favourable to devotion. Serving the devotees is the supreme fulfilment and the root of the creeper of divine love.

    mādhava-tithi    bhakti-jananī
        yatane pālana kari
    kṛṣṇa-vasati    vasati bali’
        parama ādare vari

I carefully observe the holy days related to Mādhava. They are the mother of devotion. With great adoration, I embrace the abode of Kṛṣṇa as my own.

#### 3

    gaura āmāra    ye-saba sthāne
        karala bhramaṇa raṅge
    se-saba sthāna    heriba āmi
        praṇayi-bhakata-saṅge

In the company of loving devotees, I behold all the places my Gaurasundar visited during His Pastimes.

#### 4

    mṛdaṅga-vādya    śunite mana
        avasara sadā yāche
    gaura-vihita    kīrtana śuni’
        ānande hṛdaya nāche

My heart always begs for the opportunity to hear the sound of the mṛdaṅga. Hearing the kīrtan prescribed by Śrī Gaurasundar, my heart dances with joy.

#### 5

    yugala-mūrti    dekhiyā mora
        parama-ānanda haya
    prasāda-sevā    karite haya
        sakala prapañcha jaya

Beholding the Deity forms of the Divine Couple, I feel the greatest joy. By honouring prasād, I overcome the entire material illusion.

#### 6

    ye-dina gṛhe    bhajana dekhi
        gṛhete goloka bhāya
    charaṇa-sīdhu    dekhiyā gaṅgā
        sukha nā sīmā pāya

On days when I see devotional service taking place in my home, I feel that Goloka has manifested there. Seeing the Ganges, the nectar from the Lord’s feet, my happiness has no limit.

#### 7

    tulasī dekhi’    juḍāya prāṇa
        mādhava-toṣaṇī jāni’
    gaura-priya    śāka-sevane
        jīvana sārthaka māni

Seeing Tulasī Devī soothes my soul, for I know she pleases Mādhava. Honouring śāk, Śrī Gaurasundar’s favourite, I consider my life successful.

#### 8

    bhakativinoda    kṛṣṇa-bhajane
        anukūla pāya yāhā
    prati-divase    parama-sukhe
        svīkāra karaye tāhā

Whatever Bhakti Vinod obtains that is favourable to Kṛṣṇa’s service, he accepts every day with the greatest joy.
