# Śuddha-bhakata

### By Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    śuddha-bhakata-     charaṇa-reṇu bhajana-anukūla
    bhakata-sevā      parama-siddhi prema-latikāra mūla

The dust of pure devotees’ feet is favourable to devotion. Serving the devotees is the supreme fulfilment and the root of the creeper of divine love.

    mādhava-tithi      bhakti-jananī yatane pālana kari
    kṛṣṇa-vasati          vasati bali’ parama ādare vari

I carefully observe the holy days related to Mādhava. They are the mother of devotion. With great adoration, I embrace the abode of Kṛṣṇa as my own.

    gaura āmāra       ye-saba sthāne karala bhramaṇa raṅge
    se-saba sthāna        heriba āmi praṇayi-bhakata-saṅge

In the company of loving devotees, I behold all the places my Gaurasundar visited during His Pastimes.

    mṛdaṅga-vādya       śunite mana avasara sadā yāche
    gaura-vihita         kīrtana śuni’ ānande hṛdaya nāche

My heart always begs for the opportunity to hear the sound of the mṛdaṅga. Hearing the kīrtan prescribed by Śrī Gaurasundar, my heart dances with joy.

    yugala-mūrti        dekhiyā mora parama-ānanda haya
    prasāda-sevā         karite haya sakala prapañcha jaya

Beholding the Deity forms of the Divine Couple, I feel the greatest joy. By honouring prasād, I overcome the entire material illusion.

    ye-dina gṛhe       bhajana dekhi gṛhete goloka bhāya
    charaṇa-sīdhu       dekhiyā gaṅgā sukha nā sīmā pāya

On days when I see devotional service taking place in my home, I feel that Goloka has manifested there. Seeing the Ganges, the nectar from the Lord’s feet, my happiness has no limit.

    tulasī dekhi’        juḍāya prāṇa mādhava-toṣaṇī jāni’
    gaura-priya        śāka-sevane jīvana sārthaka māni

Seeing Tulasī Devī soothes my soul, for I know she pleases Mādhava. Honouring śāk, Śrī Gaurasundar’s favourite, I consider my life successful.

#### 8

    bhakativinoda      kṛṣṇa-bhajane anukūla pāya yāhā
    prati-divase        parama-sukhe svīkāra karaye tāhā

Whatever Bhakti Vinod obtains that is favourable to Kṛṣṇa’s service, he accepts every day with the greatest joy.
