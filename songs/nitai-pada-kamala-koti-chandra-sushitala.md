# Manaḥ-Śikṣā

### by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    nitāi-pada-kamala    koṭī-chandra-suśītala
        ye chhāyāya jagata juḍāya
    hena nitāi vine bhāi    rādhā-kṛṣṇa pāite nāi
        dṛḍha kari’ dhara nitāira pāya

Cooling like ten million moons, Nitāi’s lotus feet soothe the world with their shade. O brother! Without Nitāi, you cannot reach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Firmly grasp Nitāi’s feet.

#### 2

    se sambandha nāhi yāra    vṛthā janma gela tāra
        sei paśu baḍa durāchāra
    nitāi nā balila mukhe    majila saṁsāra-sukhe
        vidyā-kule ki karibe tāra

The life of one who had no connection with Nitāi passed in vain. Such an animal is very wicked. What will learning (aristocratic birth) do for one who was immersed in worldly pleasures and never called aloud, ‘Nitāi’?

#### 3

    ahaṅkāre matta haiñā    nitāi-pada pāsariyā
        asatyere satya kari’ māni
    nitāiyer karuṇā habe    vraje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe
        dhara nitāiyer charaṇ du’khāni

Maddened with pride, forgetting Nitāi’s feet, I accept untruth as truth. When Nitāi bestows His mercy you will reach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in Vraja. Grasp Nitāi’s feet!

#### 4

    nitāiyer charaṇa satya    tā̐hāra sevaka nitya
        nitāi-pada sadā kara āśa
    narottama baḍa duḥkhī    nitāi more kara sukhī
        rākha rāṅgā-charaṇera pāśa

Nitāi’s feet are truth, and His servants are eternal. Always aspire for Nitāi’s feet. Narottam is very sad: “O Nitāi! Make me happy. Keep me beside your reddish feet.”
