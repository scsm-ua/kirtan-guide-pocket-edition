# Ṭhākura-vaiṣṇava-pada

### By Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ṭhākura-vaiṣṇava-pada    avanīra susampada
    śuna bhāi! hañā eka mana
    āśraya la-iyā bhaje      tāre kṛṣṇa nāhi tyaje
    āra saba mare akāraṇa

The worshippable Vaiṣṇavas’ feet are the greatest treasure in the world. O brother, listen attentively: take shelter of the Vaiṣṇavas and serve. Kṛṣṇa does not reject one who does so. All others die in vain.

    vaiṣṇava-charaṇa-jala   prema-bhakti dite bala
    āra keha nahe balavanta
    vaiṣṇava-charaṇa-renu  mastake bhūṣaṇa vinu
    āra nāhi bhūṣaṇera anta

The Vaiṣṇavas’ foot-water has the power to give one premabhakti. Nothing else has such power. I wear no ornament on my head other than the Vaiṣṇavas’ footdust.

    tīrtha-jala-pavitra-guṇe   likhiyāchhe purāṇe se saba bhaktira pravañchana
    vaiṣṇavera pādadoka     sama nahe ei saba yāte haya vāñchhita pūraṇa

The purifying power of water at places of pilgrimage has been described in the Purāṇas. Such statements are a devotional trick. Water from pilgrimage sites is never equal to the Vaiṣṇavas’ foot-water, which fulfils all of one’s desires.

    vaiṣṇava-saṅgete mana    ānandita anukṣaṇa sadā haya kṛṣṇa-parasaṅga
    dīna narottama kā̐nde  hiyā dhairya nāhi bāndhe mora daśā kena ha-ila bhaṅga

My mind is always joyful in the company of the Vaiṣṇavas, where discussion of Kṛṣṇa is always happening. Humble Narottam cries, “My heart has no patience. Why has my condition changed? (Why have I lost the Vaiṣṇavas’ association?)”
