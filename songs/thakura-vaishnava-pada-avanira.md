# Ṭhākura-vaiṣṇava-pada

### by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ṭhākura-vaiṣṇava-pada    avanīra susampada
        śuna bhāi! hañā eka mana
    āśraya la-iyā bhaje    tāre kṛṣṇa nāhi tyaje
        āra saba mare akāraṇa

The worshippable Vaiṣṇavas’ feet are the greatest treasure in the world. O brother, listen attentively: take shelter of the Vaiṣṇavas and serve. Kṛṣṇa does not reject one who does so. All others die in vain.

    vaiṣṇava-charaṇa-jala    prema-bhakti dite bala
        āra keha nahe balavanta
    vaiṣṇava-charaṇa-renu    mastake bhūṣaṇa vinu
        āra nāhi bhūṣaṇera anta

The Vaiṣṇavas’ foot-water has the power to give one premabhakti. Nothing else has such power. I wear no ornament on my head other than the Vaiṣṇavas’ footdust.

    tīrtha-jala-pavitra-guṇe    likhiyāchhe purāṇe
        se saba bhaktira pravañchana
    vaiṣṇavera pādadoka    sama nahe ei saba
        yāte haya vāñchhita pūraṇa

The purifying power of water at places of pilgrimage has been described in the Purāṇas. Such statements are a devotional trick. Water from pilgrimage sites is never equal to the Vaiṣṇavas’ foot-water, which fulfils all of one’s desires.

    vaiṣṇava-saṅgete mana    ānandita anukṣaṇa
        sadā haya kṛṣṇa-parasaṅga
    dīna narottama kā̐nde    hiyā dhairya nāhi bāndhe
        mora daśā kena ha-ila bhaṅga

My mind is always joyful in the company of the Vaiṣṇavas, where discussion of Kṛṣṇa is always happening. Humble Narottam cries, “My heart has no patience. Why has my condition changed? (Why have I lost the Vaiṣṇavas’ association?)”
