# Nivedana, Part 2

### By Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    gopīnāth, ghuchāo saṁsāra-jvālā avidyā-yātanā       āra nāhi sahe
    janama-maraṇa-mālā

O Gopīnāth, remove the suffering of saṁsāra. I can no longer tolerate the pain of ignorance or the cycle of birth and death.

#### 2

    gopīnāth, āmi ta’ kāmera dāsa viṣaya-vāsanā     jāgichhe hṛdaye
    phā̐dichhe karama phā̐sa

O Gopīnāth, I am a servant of lust. Worldly desires have awakened in my heart, and the noose of karma has tightened around my neck.

#### 3

    gopīnāth, kabe vā jāgiba āmi kāma-rūpa ari      dūre teyāgiba
    hṛdaye sphuribe tumi

O Gopīnāth, when will I wake up? When will I abandon my enemy—lust? When will You appear in my heart?

#### 4

    gopīnāth, āmi ta’ tomāra jana tomāre chhāḍiyā    saṁsāra bhajinu
    bhuliyā āpana-dhana

O Gopīnāth, I am Yours, but I have abandoned You and engaged in worldly life, forgetting my actual wealth.

#### 5

    gopīnāth, tumi ta’ sakali jāna
    āpanāra jane      daṇḍiyā ekhana
    śrī-charaṇe deha sthāna

O Gopīnāth, You know everything. Having now punished Your servant, give him a place at Your holy feet.

#### 6

    gopīnāth, ei ki vichāra tava vimukha dekhiyā    chhāḍa nija-jane
    nā kara karuṇā-lava

O Gopīnāth, is this Your judgement? Seeing me averse to You, You abandon Your servant and do not grant him even a trace of mercy?

#### 7

    gopīnāth, āmi ta’ mūrakha ati
    kise bhāla haya    kabhu nā bujhinu tāi hena mama gati

O Gopīnāth, I am very foolish. I have never understood what is good for me. Therefore my condition is such.

#### 8

    gopīnāth, tumi ta’ paṇḍita-vara mūḍhera maṅgala    sadā anveṣibe
    e dāse nā bhāva para

O Gopīnāth, You are the wisest person. Always try to uplift this fool and do not consider this servant an outsider.
