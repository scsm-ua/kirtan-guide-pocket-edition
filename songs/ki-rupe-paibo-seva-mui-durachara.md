# Ki-rūpe pāiba sevā

### By Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ki-rūpe pāiba sevā muñi durāchāra
    śrī-guru-vaiṣṇave rati nā haila āmāra

How will I attain service? I am a sinner and have no attachment to Śrī Guru or the Vaiṣṇavas.

#### 2

    aśeṣa māyāte mana magana ha-ila vaiṣṇavete leśa-mātra rati nā janmila

My mind has become immersed in neverending illusion. I do not have even a trace of attachment to the Vaiṣṇavas.

#### 3

    viṣaye bhuliyā andha ha-inu divā-niśi gale phā̐sa dite phere māyā se piśāchī

Immersed in the mundane day and night, I have forgotten you and become blind. The witch Māyā has come to place a noose around my neck.

#### 4

    māyāre kariyā jaya chhāḍāna nā yāya sādhu-kṛpā vinā āra nāhika upāya

It is impossible to overcome and leave behind Māyā without the sādhus’ mercy. There is no other way.

#### 5

    adoṣa-daraśi-prabhu patita-uddhāra ei-bāra narottame karaha nistāra

O master who overlooks my faults! O saviour of the fallen! This time deliver Narottam Dās.
