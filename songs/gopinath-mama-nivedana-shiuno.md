# Nivedana, Part 1

### By Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    gopīnāth, mama nivedana śuna viṣayī durjana     sadā kāma-rata
    kichhu nāhi mora guṇa

O Gopīnāth, hear my prayer. I am a wicked, constantly covetous materialist. I do not have any good qualities.

#### 2

    gopīnāth, āmāra bharasā tumi tomāra charaṇe      la-inu śaraṇa
    tomāra kiṅkara āmi

O Gopīnāth, You are my hope. I have taken shelter at Your feet. I am Your servant.

#### 3

    gopīnāth, kemane śodhibe more nā jāni bhakati     karme jaḍa-mati
    paḍechhi saṁsāra ghore

O Gopīnāth, how will You purify me? I do not understand devotion and my materialistic mind is absorbed in karma. I have fallen into this dark world.

#### 4

    gopīnāth, sakali tomāra māyā nāhi mama bala    jñāna sunirmala
    svādhīna nahe e kāyā

O Gopīnāth, everything is Your illusion. I have no strength or transcendental knowledge, and this body of mine is not independent (of material nature’s control).

#### 5

    gopīnāth, niyata charaṇe sthāna māge e pāmara      kā̐diyā kā̐diyā
    karahe karuṇā dāna

O Gopīnāth, weeping and weeping, this sinner begs for an eternal place at Your feet. Please give him Your mercy.

#### 6

    gopīnāth, tumi ta sakali pāra durjane tārite       tomāra śakati
    ke āchhe pāpīra āra

O Gopīnāth, You can do anything. You have the power to deliver sinners, and who is a greater sinner than myself?

#### 7

    gopīnāth, tumi kṛpā-pārābāra jīvera kāraṇe      āsiyā prapañche
    līlā kaile suvistāra

O Gopīnāth, You are an ocean of mercy. You came into this world and performed Your Pastimes for the sake of the fallen souls.

#### 8

    gopīnāth, āmi ki doṣera doṣī
    asura sakala         pāila charaṇa vinoda thākila vasi

O Gopīnāth, am I the greatest sinner of all? All the demons reached Your feet, and only this Bhakti Vinod remained sitting here.
