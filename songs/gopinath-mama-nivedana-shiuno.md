# Nivedana

## Part 1

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

        gopīnāth, mama nivedana śuna
    viṣayī durjana    sadā kāma-rata
        kichhu nāhi mora guṇa

O Gopīnāth, hear my prayer. I am a wicked, constantly covetous materialist. I do not have any good qualities.

#### 2

        gopīnāth, āmāra bharasā tumi
    tomāra charaṇe    la-inu śaraṇa
        tomāra kiṅkara āmi

O Gopīnāth, You are my hope. I have taken shelter at Your feet. I am Your servant.

#### 3

        gopīnāth, kemane śodhibe more
    nā jāni bhakati    karme jaḍa-mati
        paḍechhi saṁsāra ghore

O Gopīnāth, how will You purify me? I do not understand devotion and my materialistic mind is absorbed in karma. I have fallen into this dark world.

#### 4

        gopīnāth, sakali tomāra māyā
    nāhi mama bala    jñāna sunirmala
        svādhīna nahe e kāyā

O Gopīnāth, everything is Your illusion. I have no strength or transcendental knowledge, and this body of mine is not independent (of material nature’s control).

#### 5

        gopīnāth, niyata charaṇe sthāna
    māge e pāmara    kā̐diyā kā̐diyā
        karahe karuṇā dāna

O Gopīnāth, weeping and weeping, this sinner begs for an eternal place at Your feet. Please give him Your mercy.

#### 6

        gopīnāth, tumi ta sakali pāra
    durjane tārite    tomāra śakati
        ke āchhe pāpīra āra

O Gopīnāth, You can do anything. You have the power to deliver sinners, and who is a greater sinner than myself?

#### 7

        gopīnāth, tumi kṛpā-pārābāra
    jīvera kāraṇe    āsiyā prapañche
        līlā kaile suvistāra

O Gopīnāth, You are an ocean of mercy. You came into this world and performed Your Pastimes for the sake of the fallen souls.

#### 8

        gopīnāth, āmi ki doṣera doṣī
    asura sakala    pāila charaṇa
        vinoda thākila vasi

O Gopīnāth, am I the greatest sinner of all? All the demons reached Your feet, and only this Bhakti Vinod remained sitting here.
