# After parikramā

### by Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī Prabhu

    nagara bhramiyā āmāra gaura ela ghare
    gaura ela ghare āmāra nitāi ela ghare
    dhūlā jhāri’ śachīmātā gaura kole kare
    ānandete bhakta-gaṇe hari hari bale

After touring the town, my Gaurāṅga came home! My Gaurāṅga and my Nitāi came home! After dusting Him off, Śachī Mātā embraces Gaurāṅga! The devotees joyfully sing “Hari! Hari!”

    rādhe jaya jaya mādhava-dayite
    gokula-taruṇī-maṇḍala-mahite

O Rādhā! O Beloved of Mādhava! O heroine of the girls of Gokula! All glory to You! All glory to You!

    dāmodara-rati-vardhana-veśe
    hari-niṣkuṭa-vṛndā-vipineśe

O She who dresses to increase Dāmodar’s attachment! O Queen of Hari’s pleasure groves in Vṛndāvan!

    vṛṣabhānūdadhi-nava-śaśi-lekhe
    lalitā-sakhi guṇa-ramita-viśākhe

O new moon who has arisen from the ocean of King Vṛṣabhānu! O friend of Lalitā! O charmer of Viśākhā!

    karuṇāṁ kuru mayi karuṇā-bharite
    sanaka-sanātana-varṇita-charite

Be merciful to me, O You who are filled with mercy! O She whose glory is sung by Sanaka and Sanātan!
