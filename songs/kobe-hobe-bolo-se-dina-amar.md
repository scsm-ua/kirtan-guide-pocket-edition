# Kabe ha’be bala

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

        kabe ha’be bala se-dina āmāra
    (āmār) aparādha ghuchi’    śuddha nāme ruchi
        kṛpā-bale ha’be hṛdaye sañchāra

Please tell me, when will that day be mine when my offences will be dispelled and taste for the pure Name will be infused within my heart by divine grace?

#### 2

    tṛṇādhika hīna    kabe nije māni
        sahiṣṇutā-guṇa hṛdayete āni’
    sakale mānada    āpani amānī
        haye āsvādiba nāma-rasa-sāra

When will I feel myself to be lower than a blade of grass, bring the quality of tolerance within my heart, become eager to honour everyone, and, devoid of desire for honour from anyone, relish the essence of the Name’s rasa?

#### 3

    dhana jana āra    kavitā, sundarī
        baliba nā chāhi deha-sukha-karī
    janme-janme dāo    ohe gaurahari!
        ahaitukī-bhakti charaṇe tomāra

When will I declare that I do not desire wealth, followers, erudition, beautiful women, or any other bodily pleasures? O Gaurahari! Birth after birth, please give me unconditional devotion to Your feet.

#### 4

    (kabe) karite śrī-kṛṣṇa-    nāma uchāraṇa
        pulakita deha gadgada vachana
    vaivarṇya-vepathu    habe saṅghaṭana
        nirantara netre va’be aśru-dhāra

When will my hair stand on end, my voice falter, my complexion turn pale, my body tremble, and tears pour incessantly from my eyes while I call aloud Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s Name?

#### 5

    kabe navadvīpe    suradhunī-taṭe
        ‘gaura-nityānanda’ bali’ niṣkapaṭe
    nāchiyā gāiyā    beḍāiba chhuṭe
        vātulera prāya chhāḍiyā vichāra

When, in the land of Nabadwīp, on the banks of the Ganges, will I run about, guilelessly calling, “O Gaura! O Nityānanda!”, dancing and singing like a madman, giving up all considerations?

#### 6

    kabe nityānanda    more kari’ dayā
        chhāḍāibe mora viṣayera māyā
    diyā more nija-    charaṇera chhāyā
        nāmera hāṭete dibe adhikāra

When will Nityānanda be merciful to me and cause me to abandon my attachment to mundanity? When will He give me the shade of His feet and grant me a place in the marketplace of the Name?

#### 7

    kiniba, luṭiba    hari-nāma-rasa
        nāma-rase māti’ ha-iba vivaśa
    rasera rasika-    charaṇa paraśa
        kariyā majiba rase anibāra

When will I buy and festively scatter the Name’s rasa? When will I become intoxicated and overwhelmed with that rasa? When will I touch the feet of a relisher of that rasa and become immersed in that rasa perpetually?

#### 8

    kabe jīve dayā    ha-ibe udaya
        nija-sukha bhuli’ sudīna-hṛdaya
    bhakati-vinoda    kariyā vinaya
        śrī-ājñā-ṭahala karibe prachāra

When will compassion for all souls arise within me? When will Bhakti Vinod forget his own happiness and travel about respectfully preaching Śrī Gaurasundar’s teachings with a most humble heart?
